When your application is running on a television set, you should assume that the user is sitting about ten feet away from the screen. This user environment is referred to as the 10-foot UI. To provide your users with a usable and enjoyable experience, you should style and lay out your UI accordingly..

This lesson shows you how to optimize layouts for TV by:

* Providing appropriate layout resources for landscape mode.
* Ensuring that text and controls are large enough to be visible from a distance.
* Providing high resolution bitmaps and icons for HD TV screens.
